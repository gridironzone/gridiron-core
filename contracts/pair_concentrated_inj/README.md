# Gridiron Concentrated Liquidity Pair with Injective Orderbook integration

[//]: # (TODO: write README)

## Limitations
1. This implementation is intended for Injective chain only. You won't be able to store this contract anywhere else.
2. Asset infos order is important while creating a new CL pool!
   If you want to create CL pool and integrate with orderbook you must specify base_asset as a first asset and quote_asset as a second asset.
   More info in [Injective docs](https://docs.injective.network/develop/modules/Injective/exchange/spot_market_concepts#definitions).
3. This pair contract does not support CW20 tokens. Only native tokens are allowed.
4. When registering this contract in begin blocker, the proposer must ask to pin contract in memory to make orderbook integration profitable.
5. When registering pool with 'inj', funding mode = GrantOnly must be specified in registration proposal. Otherwise, contract will block execution on begin blocker.
However, contract's inj balance will be still being charged for noop operations, but Gridiron can't prevent this. 
Contract can enable itself when grant only funding mode is observed. Contract always checks funding mode on swap and provide liquidity events.
It means, that if funding mode was fixed any user will have to swap or provide liquidity to enable contract.

## InstantiateMsg

Initializes a new concentrated liquidity pair.

```json
{
  "token_code_id": 123,
  "factory_addr": "inj...",
  "asset_infos": [
    {
      "native_token": {
        "denom": "inj"
      }
    },
    {
      "native_token": {
        "denom": "peggy..."
      }
    }
  ],
  "init_params": "<base64_encoded_json_string>"
}
```

where `<base64_encoded_json_string>` is

```json
{
  "main_params": {
    "amp": "40.0",
    "gamma": "0.0001",
    "mid_fee": "0.005",
    "out_fee": "0.01",

    "min_trades_to_avg": "500"
  }
}
```

Note, the aforementioned values are just examples and have no practical meaning.

## ExecuteMsg

### `receive`

Withdraws liquidity by providing LP token.

```json
{
  "receive": {
    "sender": "terra...",
    "amount": "123",
    "msg": "<base64_encoded_json_string>"
  }
}
```

### `provide_liquidity`

Provides liquidity by sending a user's assets to the pool.

```json
{
  "provide_liquidity": {
    "assets": [
      {
        "info": {
          "native_token": {
            "denom": "inj"
          }
        },
        "amount": "1000000"
      },
      {
        "info": {
          "native_token": {
            "denom": "peggy..."
          }
        },
        "amount": "1000000"
      }
    ],
    "auto_stake": false,
    "receiver": "inj...",
    "slippage_tolerance": "0.01"
  }
}
```

### `withdraw_liquidity`

Burn LP tokens and withdraw liquidity from a pool. This call must be sent to a LP token contract associated with the
pool from which you want to withdraw liquidity from.

```json
{
  "withdraw_liquidity": {}
}
```

### `swap`

Perform a swap. `offer_asset` is your source asset and `to` is the address that will receive the ask assets. All fields
are optional except `offer_asset`.

```json
{
  "swap": {
    "offer_asset": {
      "info": {
        "native_token": {
          "denom": "inj"
        }
      },
      "amount": "123"
    },
    "belief_price": "123",
    "max_spread": "123",
    "to": "inj..."
  }
}
```

### `update_config`

Update the concentrated liquidity pair's configuration.

```json
{
  "update_config": {
    "params": "<base64_encoded_json_string>"
  }
}
```

where `<base64_encoded_json_string>` is one of

1. Update parameters

```json
{
  "update": {
    "mid_fee": "0.1",
    "out_fee": "0.01",
    ...
  }
}
```

2. Update Amp or Gamma

```json
{
  "promote": {
    "next_amp": "44",
    "next_gamma": "0.001",
    "future_time": 1570257049
  }
}
```

3. Stop Amp and Gamma change

```json
{
  "stop_changing_amp_gamma": {}
}
```

4. Update orderbook params

```json
{
  "update_orderbook_params": {
    "orders_number": 3
  }
}
```

## QueryMsg
