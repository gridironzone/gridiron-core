# Gridiron Shared Multisig

It is a multisig with two addresses created upon instantiation. Each address has its own role (manager1 or manager2), however, 
both have exactly the same permissions. Each role can propose a new address which can then claim that role.

## Instantiation

To create the multisig, you must pass in a set of address for each one to pass a proposal. To create a 2 multisig, 
pass 2 voters (manager1 and manager2).

```json
{
  "factory_addr": "wasm...",
  "max_voting_period": {
    "height": 123
  },
  "manager1": "wasm...",
  "manager2": "wasm...",
  "denom1": "wasm...",
  "denom2": "wasm...",
  "target_pool": "wasm..."
}
```
